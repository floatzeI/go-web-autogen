# Example Project One

**Building/Running**
1. Run `(insert go-web-autogen build command here)`
2. Run `./build.sh` (this will build the project and create swaggo docs).
    - Alternatively, you can just open the file and manually copy/paste each command
3. Run `./project-one` (`./project-one.exe` on Windows)
    - You can also just do `go run main.go` instead, but make sure you go through step 2 first.
4. Visit [localhost:4012/docs/index.html](http://localhost:4012/docs/index.html) to see the swagger documentation - you can experiment with the endpoints to make sure they work, and get a feel for what sort of docs are generated.
